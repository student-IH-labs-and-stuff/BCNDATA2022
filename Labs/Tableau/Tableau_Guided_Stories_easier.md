# Lab | Tableau Guided Analysis with Worksheets, Dashboards and Stories

I propose that you work with a dataset you know (eg your car insurance dataset used on the labs from last week [marketing_customer_analysis.csv](marketing_customer_analysis.csv), the global_superstore we have been using in class, or the merged/ clean H4A data set) but you can also work with the london fire brigade dataset, or you can try working with a completely new dataset for a challenge you can look at this [alternative lab](https://github.com/student-IH-labs-and-stuff/BCNDATA1021/blob/main/Labs/Tableau/Tableau_Guided_Stories.md)

Build a story compiled of individual captioned storypoints in Tableau and publish the story only to your tableau public account, in order to submit the url via the Student Portal to complete the lab. 

Utilise the annotation and duplicate storypoint features within the Story to guide the end user through the story you want to tell with your data.  For each page of your story you should consider data visualisation best practices. 
The chart choices for each story point are up to you and be as simple or complex as you like but keep in mind that the Story is ideally consumed as a semi interactive presentation. Its ok also to include some visual imagery, external research and comments but the main focus should be on visualising observations found in the data, step by step. 

(Ensure each chart has the appropriate fit, mark type, title, axis labels and legend) 


## Your challenge : 

Create a Story (at least 5 story points, worksheets and dashboards, but you can add more!) to take end users through the following or a similar / customised narrative: 

* 1 - overall summary / introduction to your Story or insight - ie whats something you have seen in the data you think worth telling us about?
* 2 - a view of the median customer lifetime or claim amount value broken down by chosen dimensions, such as sales channel or vehicle class. This could be a single chart or a dashboard. 
* 3-  a view revealing an overall trend / pattern observed within the dataset, perhaps reflected in correlations between measures (scatter plots) or the visual breakdown of a specific measure by dimensions (eg tree map, packed bubbles) 
* 4- a view which is related to the last view, but draws attention to some detail, an exception or some outliers which stand out to you. This should be ideally highlighted or annotated in some way. 
* 5- what do you want the end user to remember about your story (conclusion / main findings)
* use images, colour blocks of text, large font size etc where appropriate to relay your story, keeping in mind visual best practices
* the idea is that an end user can work through the tabs of the story with no intervention, and come out the other side better informed
