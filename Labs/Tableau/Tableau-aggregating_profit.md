# Lab | Tableau -Aggregating Profitability

Build the following charts making use of the date parts/values in tableau and publish them to your tableau public account in order to submit the url via the Student Portal

## Your Challenge

Using the data set [global_superstore](https://github.com/student-IH-labs-and-stuff/BCNDATA1021/blob/main/Labs/Tableau/Global%20Superstore.xlsx) with the Orders table and Tableau Public, create the following charts to visualise:

(Ensure each chart has the appropriate fit, chart/mark type, title, axis labels and colour scheme.)


1. Overall Profit over time by market - using Year, Quarter data values (green fields)
2. Overall profitability by Sub category - with Category, Date, Market filters
3. Average Profit compared to Discount %, Sales Amount or Quantity (your choice) with a filter for Category and Subcategory (link your filters using only relevant values)
4. Average Profit by Country (as a filled map) with a market filter, using a FIXED LOD on the label to show the global contribution of profit by each country (so that % label is unaffected by the filters when applied)  - and also with a simple bar chart viz embedded in the tool tip of the map, similar to that created in Step 2, so that when you hover over a country you can see the profitability by category
6. Create a highlight table or any other chart type to quickly see the pattern between weeks and days of the week, with profit ratio % (profit divided by sales amount) on colour - be careful with your aggregation approach, remember to pre-aggregate! 
7. Create a view showing the number of profitable transactions within each category and subcategory
8. Create a variation of the view in step 6, but use a table calculation to achieve a stacked 100% bar so that the proportion of each sub category making profit is showing  

BONUS : bring in the returns table to your data source as a related table and see if you can develop any of these views further to reflect accurately the refunded sales
